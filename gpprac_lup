GP Practice Look-Up
1.	You first need to locate a list of GP practices along with their postcode. 
2.	To do this you need to visit the following website: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/gp-and-gp-practice-related-data
3.	Locate the file called 'eppracur' (GP Practices).
4.	Put the postcodes into SQL and find the local authority you want (Generally most of our data has the CCG list included).

/* Pop your postcodes below and find the laua, this then needs aggregating up to UTLA13 and then Region */
